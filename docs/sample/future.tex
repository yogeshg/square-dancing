\section{Future Improvements}
Based on our experience, we found it to be very clear that the effectiveness of a Slather strategy depends on whether the strategy is pitted against a single other player or against several other players. We were able to independently develop two strategies that always won in one of these two cases, but we were forced to make a tradeoff for our final player. If we were to have more time on the project, weâ€™d spend time investigating the feasibility of having cells detect the number of players in the game and communicate this knowledge to all friendly cells. This would allow us to select the strategy that works best for the number of players in a particular game.

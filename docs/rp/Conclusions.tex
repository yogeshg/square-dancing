\section{Conclusions}
The key finding we made regarding Slather is that it’s very difficult to create a player that is robust across all configurations. No single strategy is ideal for all configurations, so creating robustness was a matter of understanding the tradeoffs of each strategy, and making an informed decision based on the configurations in the tournament. As the tournament results illustrate, we went with a strategy that performs excellently in pairwise competition, but is average in nine-player competition. We made this tradeoff because we knew that a significant number of the tournament runs would be pairwise. If the tournament was structured differently, or if our player was supposed to be as general purpose as possible, running on configurations unknown to us before the tournament started, we’d likely reevaluate and readjust our strategy further.
